WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net pulse5/pulse3/door_open_counter_reg[1]_P is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin pulse5/pulse3/door_open_counter_reg[3]_LDC_i_1/O, cell pulse5/pulse3/door_open_counter_reg[3]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
